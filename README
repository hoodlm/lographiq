LoGraphik - simple algorithmic art engine in ruby

== Setup ==

This library is very light and technically just requires a Ruby installation.

It's also recommended you install the ImageMagick tools, or another program
that can convert PPMs to other image formats.

== How to use ==

Invoke a lographiq script via the bin/draw executable:
bin/draw example/demo/noise.rb

This will print the ppm to stdout, so you should pipe to other sources...
bin/draw example/demo/noise.rb | ppmtobmp > ~/Pictures/noise.bmp
